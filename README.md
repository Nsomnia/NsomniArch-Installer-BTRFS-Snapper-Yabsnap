> Bash scripts to install ArchLinux with BtrFS allowing choice of none/Snapper/Yabsnap options to allow easy system rollback when you innevitably fsck something up the Arch way (btw) in 2 hours post-install.

# Overview  
A hodgepodge'd set of bash shell scripts to install ArchLinux as undestructable as possible by using a BtrFS rootfs
partition layout with very configurable subvolumes (su's/subvol's) under it.

[when the Linux drama-drag-queens flaming ends some far off day, then] BCacheFS will be an option someday perhaps,
or even ZFS when I learn it (first attempt - disaster!).

Snapper or Yabsnap are (optionally) available to be setup and used for easy 'system restore' using a subvolume
layouts reccomended by such as default. Subvols are still highly customizable at runtime.

Will try to follow the latest Arch wiki, OpenSUSE's Snapper, *or* Yabsnap reccomendations and sane defaults.

All your base-10 is belonged to me.

## Details and Overview
blah blah blah sick of writing engrish instead of baaaawsh (I'm *NOT*a sheeple, okay?!) gank'd from all over the
interwebz, alongside my nano plus shell scripting base-10 level pwn-wizardry to create a system so unbreakable that
even ChrisTitusTechTips himself would hark 'Holy Chris Titties, what a gypsy warlock!'.

```Desktop Optioons```
-> Hyprland (with or without Sway)
Oooh pretty.
-> KDE Plasma
For the she-troll that always innterupts my key smashing to watch her cartoons. 
-> DWM 
Mr.Tits getting amphet side tracked by the Picom his dots use got me interested to learn it.
linuxmobile's dwm dots are probably sick too.
-> Hyprland-xorg?
end-4/i-love-hypr-but-i-wanted-x-so-i-forked.... whatever it is is something to keep an eye out on.

With dots plugged into your batteries included using Piotr's nwg-shell python witchcraft for Sway and/or Hyprland.

(Maube eventually selections cause end-4/hyprland-dots is sick af, but I dont like the json and such used because I
have a hard time with those languages as well as from JaKooLit, ErikDubois/Arcolinux/ArcoNetPro which I've loved in
the past years a ton like boom-diggity (check out his Youtube too!), CachyOS' is clean plus sick kernel/sys work, 
plus manuel-192's arn't bad either as options.
...BTW, CachyOS' kernel-manager and sysctl-manager are decent too for basic GUI for each.)

```GPU support```
Automaticlally detected and then asked to accept/ignore, with advanced option to add anyway.
-> Nvidia
nouveau if desired, else Frogging-Family/nvidia-all (of linux-tkg notoriety. His PKGBUILDs and sh scripts are pretty
slick too as well as giving some inspiration for system optimizations and shell snippets to gank faster than any man
has ever ganked before).
-> AMD/ATI
opencl-amd from ROCm on Chaotic-AUR's repo, or ROCm/ROCr from rocm-arch/rocm-arch, or the AMD website.
-> VM/....
Note: TODO (yay serialhex nano syntax, though I am liking micro more and more)


```System Stuff```
-> Optimized makepkg for your CPU pre and post installer
-> pacman.conf using pacman.d sourced files that is my years of collecting 100's of unofficial pac-repos.
-> rustup or core/rust
-> pyinstaller, virtualenv, and that one sick python version manager tui pkg I have misplaced the name of.
-> Is miniimal even a need or thing anymore?


```Software Managment```
Flatpaks wherever possible *and* realistic alongside the Warehouse project for GUI managment of them. This makes
things *a 'lil tiny bit* more stable, allows per-user confs/files to stay well independant, and allows for easier
system root changes when things ineviently break.

(I too, have an issue and addiction with just using Paru for anything I want. 
Pro-tip: 
```$ for i in list of software-names you-want from-aur; do
    git clone $( pacman -Si | grep URL | awk '{print $2}') ${HOME}/git/$i
done```


```No category yet```
custom kernel options in Arch binary formats *or* compiled, and much much more because 'Ooooh free software, free software, you are
the king. My name is
Richard and I go by Fallman, oh the freeeee sooo-oooft-wareeeeee.' whilst he plays the bongo drums in some random foreign village. Hail satan? Hail those making constant commits keeping the world running...
...this is very very early on and all my skript-kitty snippets are strewn about a half dozen drives whilst learning tui git/git in general so... 
```$ sudo pacman -S --needed nano && nano $(fd --extension=sh . )```
